URLs
Create a file named urls.py in the same folder as the views.py file, and type this code in it:

                    from django.urls import path
                    from . import views

                    urlpatterns = [
                        path('crud/', views.members, name='Hello'),
                    ]


There is a file called urls.py on the FirstProject folder, open that file and add


                        from django.contrib import admin
                        from django.urls import include, path

                        urlpatterns = [
                            path('', include('Crud_App.urls')),
                            path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
                        ]
