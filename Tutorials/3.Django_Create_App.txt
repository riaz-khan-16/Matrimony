What is an App?
An app is a web application that has a specific meaning in your project, 
like a home page, a contact form, or a members database.
we will create an app that allows us to list and register members in a database.



Create App:
I will name my app CRUD_APP. Open another command prompt.
Go to the 'FirstProject' Folder and run this command:

               py manage.py startapp Crud_App
