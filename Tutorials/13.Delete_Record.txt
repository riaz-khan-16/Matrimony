1.Modify Template
Add a "delete" column in the members template:


            <td><a href="delete/{{ x.id }}">delete</a></td>

2.URLs:
we will add a path() function in the urls.py file

            urlpatterns = [
                path('delete/<int:id>', views.delete, name='delete'),
                ]
3.View:


        def delete(request, id):
            member = Crud.objects.get(id=id)
            member.delete()
            return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse(''))
