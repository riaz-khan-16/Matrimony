A Django model is a table in your database.


Create Table (Model):
1. go to 'models.py' file in the app folder.
Add a 'CRUD' table by creating a 'Crud' class, and describe the table fields in it:

                class Crud(models.Model):
                        field1 = models.CharField(max_length=255)
                        field2 = models.CharField(max_length=255)

SQLite Database
When we created the Django project, we got an empty SQLite database.
It was created in the project root folder, and has the filename db.sqlite3.   


2. Migrate
we must run a command to actually create the table in the database.
Run this command:

           py manage.py makemigrations portfolio


3. The table is not created yet, you will have to run one more command, 
then Django will create and execute an SQL statement, based on the content of the new file in the /migrations/ folder.
Run the migrate command:      

                   py manage.py migrate

4.you can view the SQL statement that were executed from the migration above.
 All you have to do is to run this command, with the migration number:

                    py manage.py sqlmigrate portfolio 0001
