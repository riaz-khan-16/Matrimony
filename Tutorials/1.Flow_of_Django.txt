When you have installed Django and created your first Django web application,
and the browser requests the URL, this is basically what happens:

1.Django receives the URL, checks the urls.py file, and calls the view that matches the URL.

2.The view, located in views.py, checks for relevant models.

3.The models are imported from the models.py file.

4.The view then sends the data to a specified template in the template folder.

5.The template contains HTML and Django tags, and with the data it returns finished HTML content back to the browser.
Django can do a lot more than this, but this is basically what you will learn in this tutorial, and are the basic steps in a simple web application made with Django.
