To install Django, you must have Python installed, and a package manager like PIP.
PIP is included in Python from version 3.4.



To check if your system has Python installed, run this command in the command prompt:
                            
                            python --version


To check if your system has PIP installed, run this command in the command prompt:                             
                            
                             pip --version

                             

Virtual Environment:
It is suggested to have a dedicated virtual environment for each Django project

                            py -m venv virtual_environment

This will set up a virtual environment, and create a folder named "virtual_environment" with subfolders and files       

Activate the environment:
Then you have to activate the environment, by typing this command:
                             
                             virtual_environment\Scripts\activate.bat


Install Django
Now, that we have created a virtual environment, we are ready to install Django.

                                 py -m pip install Django


You can check if Django is installed by asking for its version number like this:

                                   django-admin --version


My First Project: 


                        django-admin startproject FirstProject


Run the Django Project: enter the project folder 'FirstProject' and run the command:

                        py manage.py runserver
